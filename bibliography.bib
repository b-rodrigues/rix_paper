	abstract = {Motivation: A challenge for computational biologists is to make our analyses reproducible—i.e. to rerun, combine, and share, with the assurance that equivalent runs will generate identical results. Current best practice aims at this using a combination of package managers, workflow engines, and containers. Results: We present {BioNix}, a lightweight library built on the Nix deployment system. {BioNix} manages software dependencies, computational environments, and workflow stages together using a single abstraction: pure functions. This lets users specify workflows in a clean, uniform way, with strong reproducibility guarantees. Availability and Implementation: {BioNix} is implemented in the Nix expression language and is released on {GitHub} under the 3-clause {BSD} license: https://github.com/{PapenfussLab}/bionix (biotools:{BioNix}) ({BioNix}, {RRID}:{SCR} 017662).},
